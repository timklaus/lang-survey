#### _*Week 7 Intro To Programming (Evening) individual project submission*, *February 24, 2020*_

#### By _**Tim Klaus**_

## Description

* This project is an exercise to apply learned skills with Javascript, Jquery, Css, Bootstrap, and HTML. This project is a survey that will tell the user which programming language with which they share similar characteristics. Those languages and characteristics are:
    1. **Javascript** - Javascript seems to be a flexible and utilitarian, its pros are that it can be used for front-end and back-end and can be faster than Ruby or Python. Its cons are that it can sometimes be more difficult to maintain and can produce "Callback Hell."
    2. **Python** - Python is often described as elegant and a good first language to learn. Its pros are that it is dynamically typed which helps debugging, but its cons are that it is slow and is largely focused on computational tasks.
    3. **Ruby** - Ruby seems to be proper choice if you need a scalable web app in a short time. Its pros are that it has a quick development cycle and is described as "Magic." Its cons are that it can be difficult to debug and is notoriously slow.
